        <h2>History of Tony's Lawn Service</h2>
        <p>
          Tony Demers was born and raised in Rice Lake, Wisconsin and is the only child of Rice Lake residents 
          Jim and Jane Demers.  Tony got his first taste of the lawn care business at the early age of 11.  In 
          April 2004 when Tony was just 16 he decided to start his own business by founding Tony's Lawn Service.  
          He started off with just a push mower and a few customers willing to take a chance on the young local
          boy.  After some success in growing his customer base Tony graduated from Rice Lake High School in 2006 
          and decided to focus primarily on expanding his business and providing excellent customer service to local
          businesses and residents. 
        </p>
        <p>
          What started out as strictly a lawn mowing service has developed into much more.  Since it's inception 
          Tony's Lawn Service has blossomed into one of the premiere lawn care companies serving Rice Lake 
          and the surrounding area.  Tony understands the value of hard work and now employs three full time employees 
          along with two seasonal employees. Every aspect of Tony's Lawn Service has expanded and a majority our clientele 
          boasts loyalty of over five years.  Tony would like to thank each and everyone of his customers because 
          without them Tony's Lawn Service wouldn't be what it is today.
