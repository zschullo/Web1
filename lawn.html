        <h3>Fertilizing</h3>
          <p>

            your turf. To make certain your turf is lush and beautiful, we take care to individually address 
            your turf health and vitality throughout the growing season.

        <h3>Spring Cleanup</h3>
          <p>
            In the spring, Tony's Lawn Service can help get your lawn ready for a busy summer season. 
            We'll clean out any flower or rock beds and de-thatch the lawn to remove any dead grass clippings 
            or leaves from the previous fall season, allowing your lawn to grow thicker and greener. 
            We'll also dispose of any debris and clean up the yard so that it looks great and is ready to use.
          </p>
        <h3>Fall Cleanup</h3>
          <p>
            Make sure your lawn is properly prepared for winter.  Tony's Lawn Service will schedule a 
            cleanup day to clean flower, rock beds, mow the lawn, and bag and dispose the clippings and 
            other yard waste. Preparing for winter will help prevent buildup under the snow which can 
            suffocate and kill your lawn.
          </p>
        <h3>Weed Control</h3>
          <p>
            Upon diagnosis of your yard’s weed condition, we can custom tailor a program to begin eliminating 
            the weed species within your yard.  Proper identification and product knowledge is key, and 
            is something that we are very proud of.  We have the knowledge and capability to handle any of 
            your lawn’s weed problems.  Concerned about chemicals?  Tony's Lawn Service can give you the lawn 
            that you desire, along with the caution that you demand.  We have families just like you do.  
            Our technicians have been trained to spot spray and use chemicals carefully, only on the areas 
            that need to be treated.
          </p>
        <h3>Lime Application</h3>
          <p>
            Lime is a necessary part of a healthy lawn, helping to maintain the proper PH levels and give 
            you a thicker, greener lawn.  The results of lime treatment are not immediate - it usually takes 
            about a year to break down in the soil and provide full benefits to your lawn.  Lime is safe 
            to use.  The pelleted form applied to turf are non-toxic to humans or grass and will not 
            cause pollution problems.  Soil testing can be done to get an analysis on the soil nutrients.
