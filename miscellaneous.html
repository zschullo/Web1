        <h3>Garden Tilling</h3>
        <p>
          Prepare your soil for planting with our professional tilling service.  Whether you're starting a 
          new garden or getting an old garden ready for the growing season, Tony's Lawn Service is ready 
          to get that first step started for you.  Garden tilling can be back-breaking work, but we have 
          the proper equipment to get the job done right.  We'll get your garden ready for planting and 
          before you know it, you'll have delicious home grown produce.  Not only that but it will be a 
          fraction of the cost of store bought produce plus there aren't any added chemicals and you know 
          exactly where everything was grown.

        <h3>Tree Trimming</h3>
        <p>
          A properly trimmed tree can not only be healthier, but also safer and easier to move around 
          for lawn care purposes.  We offer tree trimming or also known as "limbing" to low lying branches 
          that can be dangerous to walk under or try and mow around.  We also offer total tree removal as 
          long as it is non-hazardous.
        </p>
        <h3>Core Aerating</h3>
        <p>
          A core lawn aerator has hollow tines. As it removes cores out of the lawn, giving the soil more 
          room for expansion. This is essential to building healthy turf. Compacted soils will stunt the 
          development of root systems. The minute it stops raining, these grasses can turn yellow and go dormant. 
           In the summer, clay soil can expand without drastically hardening the surface of the soil.  When you 
          water your lawn after aerating you will notice water soaking in rather than running off. The 
          holes hold the water. They also allow it to soak in 1 to 2 inches below the surface of the soil. 
          This makes your watering more effective, but it allows promotes deeper root growth.
