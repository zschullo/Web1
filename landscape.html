        <h3>Landscape Service</h3>
        <p>
          A properly maintained landscape is essential to any home but this process sometimes requires 
          quite a bit of work, the right tools and knowledge to be done correctly.  Landscaping can 
          add property value to your home and add beauty to your residence.  A properly maintained 
          landscape adds strong curb appeal when wanting to sell your home.  We provide the services 
          needed to install, maintain or revive your landscape.
        </p>
        <h3>Mulch</h3>
        <p>
          One of the main reasons that mulch is important is that it can hold up to 20% more moisture 
          in the landscape beds and it also keeps the soil temperature about 10 degrees cooler in the 
          landscape beds as well as preventing a lot of weeds coming up.  The direct sunlight can't 
          necessarily expose the seedling to germination and it also increases the home value by about 10%.  
          The curb appeal to freshly installed mulch is very high and often can make the residence 
          look completely refreshed.  
        </p>
        <h3>Shrub Trimming</h3>
        <p>
          There are several benefits to pruning. Irregular growing habits can be corrected. It can bring 
          in an earlier bloom period. It can cause flower and fruit size to skyrocket. It also can aid in 
          controlling disease and pests.  Pruning equipment is continually sharpened and adjusted to 
          provide your plants the best cut possible.  Our commitment to buying only the best equipment 
          available further ensures good results.  Even with regular pruning, foundation plantings 
          have a "lifetime" of about 15 years.  When it's time to renovate your existing shrub beds, we 
          have the equipment to safely remove your old shrubs to make way for new ones.  An updated 
          landscape will "freshen-up" your curb appeal while adding value to your home.  
        </p>
        <h3>Roundup</h3>
        <p>
          Roundup Spraying eliminates the need to pick weeds, and in most cases the number of weeds to 
          pick, or the area that they are required to weed is too large by hand.  Most people do not want 
          to mess around with chemicals whether it be buying it at the store, mixing it, spraying it, 
          storing it, and disposing of it properly.  Leave it up to us.  We offer bare ground sterilization 
          early summer and late summer.
